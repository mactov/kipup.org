KIP stands for Knowledge Is Power. Our aim is fight against all forms of oscurantism by providing verified, unambiguous knowledge. The idea of this site was born after reading the results of a poll where 10% of the answering people thought the Earth was flat. How can this be? In the 21st century, in the era of Internet, fake information is growing faster than scientific knowledge. The darkest political beliefs are raising and the possibility of a third World War is increasing, religions are regaining momentum, wokism is rewriting history, eco-fanatics are so desperate they stick their hands to roads or famous paintings.

At KIP, we think knowledge is the root of understanding how this crazy world is spinning around (sorry flatearthers but it really spins) how technologies work and how we can use them to improve the world and not let others fool you.
